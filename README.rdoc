== README

A Rails app built in 48 hours in an attempt to replicate real world project deadlines. The goal was to create an application similar to sites built for the Tribeca Film Festival.

The stack is Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript (AJAX and the JQuery library) and custom CSS for the front-end design.  Functionality includes the ability to review films, comment on reviews, order films by average review rating and select "winner" films in a given category based on highest average rating.
